## Reproducing Results

### Running the Code

Create an environment (e.g., using `pip` or `conda`) and install the packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

To train the models run,
```
python -m nav_to_center.run run nav_to_center/config/test.py -j20
```
where `temperature.py` is the config-generating file and `-j20` specifies the number of parallel threads to use.
You can run TensorBoard in `log/` or `log/subdir/` to track training progress.

After training the models, you must generate the evaluation data with those trained models.
```
python -m nav_to_center eval log/temperature -j20
```
where `log/temperature` contains the trained models generated by the previous step.

Finally run the analysis using,
```
python -m nav_to_center analyze corr_temp
```
where `core_temp` is the name of analysis given in `nav_to_center/analysis_configs.py`.
The results of the linear regression analysis will be printed to the screen; the figures will be saved under `results/subdir/` as specified in `analysis_config.py`.


### Analyses Used in the Paper

We use the following analyses in the paper:
- `corr_sparsity` - correlation between reward sparsity and entropy;
  data generated using `config/sparsity.py`
- `corr_temp` - correlation between bottleneck temperature and entropy;
  data generated using `config/temperature.py`
- `corr_lr` - correlation between learning rate and entropy;
  data generated using `config/learning_rate.py`
- `corr_lexicon_size` - correlation between lexicon size and entropy;
  data generated using `config/lexicon_size.py`
